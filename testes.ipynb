Long thought to be the work of over imaginative writers, the author now takes the subject beyond the void of pure speculation and into the realm of 21st Century science. For according the COMMANDER X -- a former military intelligence operative with connections to the CIA and Defense Department, on a number of occasions he witnessed the testing of highly classified super TOP SECRET black project aircraft engaged in maneuvers over Area 51 in the Nevada desert. Furthermore, the national whistle-blower claims he actually sat at the helm of one of these ships as it bio-located from one place to another...INSTANTLY! What was so unusual <hi>about</hi> these flights over Area 51 is the fact that the technology being tested involved principles of teleportation gleamed from reverse engineering of alien spacecraft which have crashed to Earth. The author maintains that extraterrestrials have been trying to feed us clues regarding the existence of this interstellar mode of transport which will enable us to instantly maneuver between two points in the twinkle of an eye! COMMANDER X further insists it is within the realm of possibility for the reader of this book to learn the fundamentals of teleportation and participate in experiments of their very own -- no matter how outlandish this may seem! In detail, he describes his own work with the military in developing skills necessary to engage in spontaneous teleportation...skills that could very well lead you along the path to personal gratification and success. The book also delves into the impact the STAR TREK series has had on introducing the general public to what is just around the bend for our world and the possibility this is part of a grass roots campaign to inform the public on a need to know basis a little bit at a time. In addition, up to date information from the Lost Journals of Nikola Tesla reveal what the great mind of all time knew <hi>about</hi> teleportation and how he helped institute this process as part of the Top Secret Philadelphia Experiment.', 'documentid': 'id:bookrec:doc::1892062437', 'title': 'Teleportation: From Star Trek to Tesla'}}, {'id': 'id:bookrec:doc::0786808381', 'relevance': 5.636624745108348, 'source': 'hybridsearchbv_content', 'fields': {'description': \"Introduce your babies to birds, cats, dogs, and babies through fine art, illustration, and photographs.

His time was almost entirely occupied with public affairs, in the management of which, though he employed many agents, he appears to have had none in the character of actual minister. Caesar deprecated a lingering death, and wished that his own might be sudden and speedy. And the day before he died, the conversation at supper, in the house of Marcus Lepidus, turning upon what wasthe most eligible way of dying, he gave his opinion in favor of a death that is sudden and unexpected.

Suddenly, fate grabs hold of his insignificant life and carries him off to Buenos Aires, to a conference on Edgar Allan Poe, the inventor of the modern detective story. There Vogelstein meets his idol, Jorge Luis Borges, and for reasons that a mere passion for literature cannot explain, he finds himself at the center of a murder investigation that involves arcane demons, the mysteries of the Kaballah, the possible destruction of the world, and the Elizabethan magus John Dee's theory of the Eternal Orangutan, which, given all the time in the world, would end up writing all the known <hi>books</hi> in the cosmos. Verissimo's small masterpiece is at once a literary tour de force and a brilliant mystery novel.\", 'documentid': 'id:bookrec:doc::081121592X', 'title': 'Borges and the Eternal Orangutans'}}, {'id': 'id:bookrec:doc::0060511117', 'relevance': 3.533137440154874, 'source': 'hybridsearchbv_content', 'fields': {'description': 'Starring everyone\\'s favourite literal–minded housekeeper, Amelia Bedelia Helps Out appears for the first time in full colour and as an I Can Read Book!
